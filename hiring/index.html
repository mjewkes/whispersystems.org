        Protect everyday privacy.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Our sole mission is developing free, well designed privacy tools. We are not a business, which means we have no VC obligations, and no management to appease. Our technology is currently used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

      <h4>
        Open Source. Exceptional Software.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Open Whisper Systems builds quality, open-source software. Every line of code or pixel adjustment is reviewed by a community of thousands. With the bar set high, we develop with the focus on quality and correctness. Excellence in our work is not just important, its necessary.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Bring your opinions.
      </h4>
      <p>
        We need skilled hands and strong voices, not worker-bees. Opinions and vision are mandatory. We have neither the time nor the inclination to breathe down your neck. You’ll have to take pride in your work, as you'll  be responsible for it. 
      </p>
